    <string name="browser_accessibility_service_text">Allow Notiplay to read the address bar in Chrome. Chrome sometimes hides the address bar when a scroll down action is performed. This service checks for the address bar and performs a scroll up gesture if it cannot find the adress bar in the viewport. With this service turned on, an notification appears as soon as the currently watched YouTube video is identified to transition to background playback with Notiplay. </string>
